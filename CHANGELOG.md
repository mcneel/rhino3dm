- (js, py) Added tests for various ::Delete methods.
- (js, py) Extrusion::CreateWithPlane #636
- (js, py) BND_Bitmap also inherits from Common object and now exposes an Id property.
- (js, py) DimensionStyle now has an Id property
- (js, py) File3dm.ObjectTable.AddPoint now supports attributes #665 @StudioWEngineers
- (js, py) File3dm.ObjectTable.AddLine now supports attributes #666 @StudioWEngineers
- (js) Layer.Index #655

### Changed

- (py) switching from pybind11 to nanobind. WIP. This affects a lot of the src/binding files, which now include many `#if defined()`. When the switch is complete these will be cleaned up. This involved adding conditions for methods that returned BND_TUPLE and adding new methods for where we were using TUPLES as arrays. For this release, we still use pybind11.

### Removed

- (py) GitHub is deprecating macos-12 runners, so they have been removed from the python builds


## [8.9.0] - 2024.07.19

diff: https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/compare/8.6.1...8.9.0

See changes in 8.9.0-beta.

### Fixed

- (js) AnnotationBase objects would be undefined due to new cast to Text in the bindings but no Text class exposed to emscripten

## [8.9.0-beta] - 2024.07.12

diff: https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/compare/8.6.1...8.9.0-beta

### Added
 - (py, js) CachedTextureCoordinates class
 - (py, js) Mesh.SetCachedTextureCoordinates and Mesh.GetCachedTextureCoordinates
 - (py, js) TextureMapping.HasId and TextureMapping.Id
 - (py, js) Added many Annotation classes and enums [#627](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/pull/627) @jesterKing
 - (all) A series of automated tests have been added and are run on all ci builds

 ### Changed
 - Updated OpenNURBS to v8.9 diff: https://github.com/mcneel/opennurbs/compare/v8.6.24101.05001...update-1718616159-8.9
 - (py, js) Several methods that take in arrays/lists of points have been updated to either be overloaded and take `Point3dList` and `std::vector<T>` (for py) or `emscripten::val` and the type is checked in cpp (for js). This means the SDK is not broken and users can pass in language specific lists / arrays of points. [#620](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/issues/620), [#616](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/issues/616)
 - (py) x86_64 Linux builds are now build using the manylinux_2_28_x86_64 docker image


 ### Fixed
 - (py, js) Polyline.CreateFromPoints now works [#616](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/issues/616)
 - (js) None of the PointCloud.AddRange* methods were working in js. This is fixed. [#620](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/issues/620)
 - (py, js) Polyline.GetSegments() always returned an extra NULL at the end of the segment array. [#623](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/issues/623)
 - (py) Universal builds for native library on macos. (#617)[https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/pull/617] @jesterKing

 ### Removed
 - (py, dotnet) GitHub has deprecated building on macos-11 so from this point forward we will not build python wheels for macos-11. macos-14 will be used to build the dotnet library for macos.
 - (dotnet) GitHub deprecated actions that run on node.js < 20 which means that we cannot build on Amazon Linux 2 in with ci workflow. For now the ci linux build uses ubuntu-latest.

## [8.6.1] - 2024.05.10

- (py) EmbeddedFile.Read()

### Changed
- (js) js docs now use typedoc for generating documentation from `src/js/rhino3dm.d.ts` [#594](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/issues/594)
- (js, py) InstanceDefinitionTable.Add(idef) is now InstanceDefinitionTable.AddInstanceDefinition(idef). This aligns dotnet, js, and py InstanceDefinitionTable.Add method args.

- (js, py) LineType bindings [@coditect](https://github.com/coditect)
- (js, py) BND_GroupTable Delete [@coditect](https://github.com/coditect)
- (js, py) BND_Xform methods and properties [@coditect](https://github.com/coditect)
- (js, py) additional file3dm properties [@coditect](https://github.com/coditect)
- (js, py) DateTime bindings [@coditect](https://github.com/coditect)
- (.net, js, py) Texture Repeat, Offset, and Rotation properties
- (js, py) Several methods related to PointClouds and values ( Add(point, value), etc )
- (js) toList() for NurbsSurfaceKnotList and NurbsCurveKnotList

### Changed
- (js) All File3dm table count are properties whereas before they were functions
- (js) PolyCurve Append methods are now appendArc, appendLine, and appendCurve. Related to #550
- (py) Updated PyBind11 from 2.9.1 to 2.11.1
- (js) CI builds for rhino3dm.js include debug information for debugging with Chrome. Hence, the resulting wasm file is much larger (40+mb) than the release build. This is triggered in the setup step with the -d or --debug flag: `python3 script/setup.py -p js -d`
- (js, py) bnd_anotationbase.cpp renamed to bnd_anotationbase.cpp

### Fixed
- (js, py) BND_Box.PointAt returned incorrect coordinates. #556
- (js) any method returning std::vector would be undefined. This was switched to return BND_TUPLE. No adverse effects on python build. #553
- (js) emscripten does not support overloaded ctors or methods that have the same number of arguments. This means many of the bindings had unusable ctors or methods. We've fixed this by giving each element a unique name (in the case of methods) or creating uniquely named static ctors. This will create some additional challenges for the documentation, but will result in more available ctors and methods. Meshes, ArcCurve, PolyCurve, Transforms, and several other objects were affected by this change. #550
- (js, py) BND_PointCloud::Add4 add color twice and does nothing with normal #551
