   .. py:staticmethod:: Create(dimension, isRational, order0, order1, controlPointCount0, controlPointCount1)

      Constructs a new NURBS surface with internal uninitialized arrays.

      :param int dimension: The number of dimensions.>= 1. This value is usually 3.
      :param bool isRational: True to make a rational NURBS.
      :param int order0: The order in U direction.>= 2.
      :param int order1: The order in V direction.>= 2.
      :param int controlPointCount0: Control point count in U direction.>= order0.
