.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: Line

   .. py:method:: Line(from, to)

      Constructs a new line segment between two points.

      :param rhino3dm.Point3d from: Start point of line.
      :param rhino3dm.Point3d to: End point of line.

   .. py:attribute:: From

      rhino3dm.Point3d: Start point of line segment.

   .. py:attribute:: To

      rhino3dm.Point3d: End point of line segment.

   .. py:attribute:: IsValid

      bool: Gets a value indicating whether or not this line is valid.
      Valid lines must have valid start and end points, and the points must not be equal.

   .. py:attribute:: Length

      float: Gets or sets the length of this line segment.
      Note that a negative length will invert the line segment without
      making the actual length negative. The line From point will remain fixed
      when a new Length is set.

   .. py:attribute:: Direction

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the direction of this line segment.
      The length of the direction vector equals the length of
      the line segment.

   .. py:attribute:: UnitTangent

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the tangent of the line segment.
      Note that tangent vectors are always unit vectors.

   .. py:method:: PointAt(t)

      Evaluates the line at the specified parameter.

      :param float t: Parameter to evaluate line segment at. Line parameters are normalized parameters.

      :return: The point at the specified parameter.

      :rtype: rhino3dm.Point3d
