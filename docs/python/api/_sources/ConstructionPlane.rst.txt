.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: ConstructionPlane

   .. py:method:: ConstructionPlane()

      ConstructionPlane constructor


   .. py:attribute:: Plane

      rhino3dm.Plane: Gets or sets the geometric plane to use for construction.

   .. py:attribute:: GridSpacing

      float: Gets or sets the distance between grid lines.

   .. py:attribute:: SnapSpacing

      float: when "grid snap" is enabled, the distance between snap points.
      Typically this is the same distance as grid spacing.

   .. py:attribute:: GridLineCount

      int: Gets or sets the total amount of grid lines in each direction.

   .. py:attribute:: ThickLineFrequency

      int: Gets or sets the recurrence of a wider line on the grid.
      0: No lines are thick, all are drawn thin.1: All lines are thick.2: Every other line is thick.3: One line in three lines is thick (and two are thin).4: ...

   .. py:attribute:: DepthBuffered

      bool: Gets or sets whether the grid is drawn on top of geometry.
      false=grid is always drawn behind 3d geometrytrue=grid is drawn at its depth as a 3d plane and grid lines obscure things behind the grid.

   .. py:attribute:: Name

      str: Gets or sets the name of the construction plane.
