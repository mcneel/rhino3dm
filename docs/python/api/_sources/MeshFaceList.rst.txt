.. py:class:: MeshFaceList

   .. py:attribute:: Count

      int: Gets or sets the number of mesh faces. When getting this can includes invalid faces.

   .. py:attribute:: QuadCount

      int: Gets the number of faces that are valid quads (4 corners).

   .. py:attribute:: TriangleCount

      int: Gets the number of faces that are valid triangles (3 corners).

   .. py:attribute:: Capacity

      int: Gets or sets the total number of mesh triangles and quads the internal data structure can hold without resizing.

   .. py:method:: __len__()

      [todo] add documentation

   .. py:method:: __getitem__()

      [todo] add documentation

   .. py:method:: Clear()

      Clears the Face list on the mesh.

      :rtype: void

   .. py:method:: Destroy()

      Releases all memory allocated to store faces. The list capacity will be 0 after this call.
      Subsequent calls can add new items.

      :rtype: void

   .. py:method:: AddFace(vertex1, vertex2, vertex3)

      Appends a new mesh face to the end of the mesh face list.

      :return: The index of the newly added face.
      :rtype: int

   .. py:method:: AddFace(vertex1, vertex2, vertex3, vertex4)

      Appends a new mesh face to the end of the mesh face list.

      :return: The index of the newly added face.
      :rtype: int

   .. py:method:: SetFace(index, vertex1, vertex2, vertex3)

      Sets a face at a specific index of the mesh.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded, otherwise false.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: SetFace(index, vertex1, vertex2, vertex3, vertex4)

      Sets a face at a specific index of the mesh.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded, otherwise false.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: ConvertQuadsToTriangles()

      Splits all quads along the short diagonal.

      :return: True on success, False on failure.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: ConvertNonPlanarQuadsToTriangles()

      Splits non-planar quads into two triangles based on given parameters.

      :return: Number of quads that were converted to triangles.
      :rtype: int

   .. py:method:: ConvertTrianglesToQuads()

      Joins adjacent triangles into quads if the resulting quad is 'nice'.

      :return: True on success, False on failure.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: CullDegenerateFaces()

      Attempts to removes degenerate faces from the mesh.
      Degenerate faces are faces that contains such a combination of indices,
      that their final shape collapsed in a line or point.Before returning, this method also attempts to repair faces by juggling
      vertex indices.

      :return: The number of degenerate faces that were removed.
      :rtype: int

   .. py:method:: IsHidden()

      Gets a value indicating whether a face is hidden.
      A face is hidden if, and only if, at least one of its vertices is hidden.

      :return: True if hidden, False if fully visible.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: HasNakedEdges()

      Returns True if at least one of the face edges are not topologically
      connected to any other faces.

      :return: True if that face makes the mesh open, otherwise false.
      :rtype: bool
