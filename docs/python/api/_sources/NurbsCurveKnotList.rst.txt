NurbsCurveKnotList
==================

.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: NurbsCurveKnotList

   .. py:attribute:: IsClampedStart

      bool: Gets a value indicating whether or not the knot vector is clamped at the start of the curve.
      Clamped curves start at the first control-point. This requires fully multiple knots.

   .. py:attribute:: IsClampedEnd

      bool: Gets a value indicating whether or not the knot vector is clamped at the end of the curve.
      Clamped curves are coincident with the first and last control-point. This requires fully multiple knots.

   .. py:method:: InsertKnot(value, multiplicity)

      Inserts a knot and update control point locations.
      Does not change parameterization or locus of curve.

      :return: True on success, False on failure.

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: KnotMultiplicity(index)

      Get knot multiplicity.

      :param int index: Index of knot to query.

      :return: The multiplicity (valence) of the knot.

      :rtype: int

   .. py:method:: CreateUniformKnots(knotSpacing)

      Compute a clamped, uniform knot vector based on the current
      degree and control point count. Does not change values of control
      vertices.

      :param float knotSpacing: Spacing of subsequent knots.

      :return: True on success, False on failure.

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: CreatePeriodicKnots(knotSpacing)

      Compute a clamped, uniform, periodic knot vector based on the current
      degree and control point count. Does not change values of control
      vertices.

      :param float knotSpacing: Spacing of subsequent knots.

      :return: True on success, False on failure.

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: SuperfluousKnot(start)

      Computes the knots that are superfluous because they are not used in NURBs evaluation.
      These make it appear so that the first and last curve spans are different from interior spans.

      :param bool start: True if the query targets the first knot. Otherwise, the last knot.

      :return: A component.

      :rtype: float
