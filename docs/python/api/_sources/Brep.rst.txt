.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: Brep

   .. py:method:: Brep()

      Brep constructor


   .. py:attribute:: Faces

      Collections.BrepFaceList: Gets the brep faces list accessor.

   .. py:attribute:: Surfaces

      Collections.BrepSurfaceList: Parametric surfaces used by faces

   .. py:attribute:: Edges

      Collections.BrepEdgeList: Gets the brep edges list accessor.

   .. py:attribute:: IsSolid

      bool: Determines whether this brep is a solid, or a closed oriented manifold.

   .. py:attribute:: IsManifold

      bool: Gets a value indicating whether or not the Brep is manifold.
      Non-Manifold breps have at least one edge that is shared among three or more faces.

   .. py:attribute:: IsSurface

      bool: Returns True if the Brep has a single face and that face is geometrically the same
      as the underlying surface.  I.e., the face has trivial trimming.
      In this case, the surface is the first face surface. The flag
      Brep.Faces[0].OrientationIsReversed records the correspondence between the surface's
      natural parametric orientation and the orientation of the Brep.trivial trimming here means that there is only one loop curve in the brep
      and that loop curve is the same as the underlying surface boundary.

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromMesh(mesh, trimedTriangles)

      Create a brep representation of a mesh

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromBox(box)

      Constructs new brep that matches a bounding box.

      :param rhino3dm.BoundingBox box: A box to use for creation.

      :return: A new brep; or None on failure.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromBox(box)

      Constructs new brep that matches a bounding box.

      :param rhino3dm.BoundingBox box: A box to use for creation.

      :return: A new brep; or None on failure.

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromCylinder(cylinder, capBottom, capTop)

      Constructs a Brep definition of a cylinder.

      :param Cylinder cylinder: cylinder.IsFinite() must be true.
      :param bool capBottom: if True end at cylinder.m_height[0] should be capped.
      :param bool capTop: if True end at cylinder.m_height[1] should be capped.

      :return: A Brep representation of the cylinder with a single face for the cylinder, \
         an edge along the cylinder seam, and vertices at the bottom and top ends of this \
         seam edge. The optional bottom/top caps are single faces with one circular edge \
         starting and ending at the bottom/top vertex.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromSphere(sphere)

      Constructs a Brep definition of a sphere.

      :param rhino3dm.Sphere sphere: The input sphere provides the orienting plane and radius.

      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateQuadSphere(sphere)

      Constructs a Brep definition of a quad sphere.

      :param rhino3dm.Sphere sphere: The input sphere provides the orienting plane and radius.

      :return: A Brep if successful, None on error.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromCone(cone, capBottom)

      Constructs a Brep representation of the cone with a single
      face for the cone, an edge along the cone seam,
      and vertices at the base and apex ends of this seam edge.
      The optional cap is a single face with one circular edge
      starting and ending at the base vertex.

      :param Cone cone: A cone value.
      :param bool capBottom: if True the base of the cone should be capped.

      :return: A Brep if successful, None on error.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromRevSurface(surface, capStart, capEnd)

      Constructs a brep form of a surface of revolution.

      :param RevSurface surface: The surface of revolution.
      :param bool capStart: if true, the start of the revolute is not on the axis of revolution, \
         and the surface of revolution is closed, then a circular cap will be \
         added to close of the hole at the start of the revolute.
      :param bool capEnd: if true, the end of the revolute is not on the axis of revolution, \
         and the surface of revolution is closed, then a circular cap will be \
         added to close of the hole at the end of the revolute.

      :return: A Brep if successful, None on error.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateFromSurface(surface)

      Constructs a Brep from a surface. The resulting Brep has an outer boundary made
      from four trims. The trims are ordered so that they run along the south, east,
      north, and then west side of the surface's parameter space.

      :param rhino3dm.Surface surface: A surface to convert.

      :return: Resulting brep or None on failure.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:staticmethod:: CreateTrimmedPlane(plane, curve)

      Create a Brep trimmed plane.

      :param rhino3dm.Plane plane: Plane that will be trimmed.
      :param rhino3dm.Curve curve: A simple (no self intersections) closed curve that defines the outer boundary of the trimmed plane.

      :return: Resulting brep or None on failure.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Brep

   .. py:method:: Flip()

      Reverses entire brep orientation of all faces.

      :rtype: void
