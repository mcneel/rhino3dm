.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: ObjectAttributes

   .. py:method:: ObjectAttributes()

      ObjectAttributes constructor


   .. py:attribute:: Mode

      ObjectMode: An object must be in one of three modes: normal, locked or hidden.
      If an object is in normal mode, then the object's layer controls visibility
      and selectability. If an object is locked, then the object's layer controls
      visibility by the object cannot be selected. If the object is hidden, it is
      not visible and it cannot be selected.

   .. py:attribute:: IsInstanceDefinitionObject

      bool: Use this query to determine if an object is part of an instance definition.

   .. py:attribute:: Visible

      bool: Gets or sets an object's visibility.

   .. py:attribute:: CastsShadows

      bool: Gets or sets an object's casts shadows property, or whether or not an object casts shadows on other objects and a ground plane.

   .. py:attribute:: ReceivesShadows

      bool: Gets or sets an object's receives shadows property, or whether or not an object receives shadows from other objects.

   .. py:attribute:: LinetypeSource

      ObjectLinetypeSource: The Linetype used to display an object is specified in one of two ways.
      If LinetypeSource is ON::linetype_from_layer, then the object's layer ON_Layer::Linetype() is used.
      If LinetypeSource is ON::linetype_from_object, then value of m_linetype is used.

   .. py:attribute:: ColorSource

      ObjectColorSource: The color used to display an object is specified in one of three ways.
      If ColorSource is ON::color_from_layer, then the object's layer ON_Layer::Color() is used.
      If ColorSource is ON::color_from_object, then value of m_color is used.
      If ColorSource is ON::color_from_material, then the diffuse color of the object's
      render material is used.  See ON_3dmObjectAttributes::MaterialSource() to
      determine where to get the definition of the object's render material.

   .. py:attribute:: PlotColorSource

      ObjectPlotColorSource: The color used to plot an object on paper is specified in one of three ways.
      If PlotColorSource is ON::plot_color_from_layer, then the object's layer ON_Layer::PlotColor() is used.
      If PlotColorSource is ON::plot_color_from_object, then value of PlotColor() is used.

   .. py:attribute:: PlotWeightSource


   .. py:attribute:: Id


   .. py:attribute:: Name

      str: Gets or sets an object optional text name.
      More than one object in a model can have the same name and
      some objects may have no name.

   .. py:attribute:: Url

      str: Objects may have an URL. There are no restrictions on what value this
      URL may have. As an example, if the object came from a commercial part
      library, the URL might point to the definition of that part.

   .. py:attribute:: LayerIndex

      int: Gets or sets an associated layer index.
      Layer definitions in an OpenNURBS model are stored in a layer table.
      The layer table is conceptually an array of ON_Layer classes.  Every
      OpenNURBS object in a model is on some layer.  The object's layer
      is specified by zero based indices into the ON_Layer array.

   .. py:attribute:: LinetypeIndex

      int: Gets or sets the linetype index.
      Linetype definitions in an OpenNURBS model are stored in a linetype table.
      The linetype table is conceptually an array of ON_Linetype classes. Every
      OpenNURBS object in a model references some linetype.  The object's linetype
      is specified by zero based indices into the ON_Linetype array.Index 0 is reserved for continuous linetype (no pattern).

   .. py:attribute:: MaterialIndex

      int: Gets or sets the material index.
      If you want something simple and fast, set the index of
      the rendering material.

   .. py:attribute:: MaterialSource

      ObjectMaterialSource: Determines if the simple material should come from the object or from it's layer.
      High quality rendering plug-ins should use m_rendering_attributes.

   .. py:attribute:: ObjectColor

      System.Drawing.Color: If ON::color_from_object == ColorSource, then color is the object's display color.

   .. py:attribute:: PlotColor

      System.Drawing.Color: If plot_color_from_object == PlotColorSource, then PlotColor is the object's plotting color.

   .. py:attribute:: DisplayOrder

      int: Display order used to force objects to be drawn on top or behind each other.
      Larger numbers draw on top of smaller numbers.
      0  = draw object in standard depth buffered order<0 = draw object behind "normal" draw order objects>0 = draw object on top of "normal" draw order objects

   .. py:attribute:: PlotWeight

      float: Plot weight in millimeters.
      =0.0 means use the default width
      <0.0 means don't plot (visible for screen display, but does not show on plot)

   .. py:attribute:: ObjectDecoration

      ObjectDecoration: Used to indicate an object has a decoration (like an arrowhead on a curve)

   .. py:attribute:: WireDensity

      int: When a surface object is displayed in wireframe, this controls
      how many isoparametric wires are used.
      value    number of isoparametric wires
      -1       boundary wires (off)
      0        boundary and knot wires
      1        boundary and knot wires and, if there are no interior knots, a single interior wire.
      N>=2     boundary and knot wires and (N+1) interior wires.

   .. py:attribute:: ViewportId

      Guid: If ViewportId is nil, the object is active in all viewports. If ViewportId is not nil, then
      this object is only active in a specific view. This field is primarily used to assign page
      space objects to a specific page, but it can also be used to restrict model space to a
      specific view.

   .. py:attribute:: ActiveSpace


   .. py:attribute:: GroupCount

      int: number of groups object belongs to.

   .. py:method:: Transform(transform)

      Apply a transformation.

      :param Transform xform: The transformation.

      :return: True if successful, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: HasDisplayModeOverride(viewportId)

      Determines if an object has a display mode override for a given viewport.

      :param Guid viewportId: Id of a Rhino Viewport.

      :return: True if the object has a display mode override for the viewport; otherwise, false.
      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: DrawColor(doc)

      [todo] add documentation

   .. py:method:: GetGroupList()

      Returns an array of GroupCount group indices.  If GroupCount is zero, then GetGroupList() returns null.

      :return: An array of group indices. None might be returned in place of an empty array.
      :rtype: int[]

   .. py:method:: AddToGroup()

      Adds object to the group with specified index by appending index to
      group list.
      If the object is already in group, nothing is changed.

      :rtype: void

   .. py:method:: RemoveFromGroup()

      removes object from the group with specified index.
      If the object is not in the group, nothing is changed.

      :rtype: void

   .. py:method:: RemoveFromAllGroups()

      Removes object from all groups.

      :rtype: void
