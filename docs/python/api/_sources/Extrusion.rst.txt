      outer profile is closed, then end caps are added as the last two faces of the brep.

         has end caps. If outerProfile is an open curve, cap is ignored.

      :return: True if the profile was set. If the outer profile is closed, then the \
         extrusion may also have inner profiles. If the outer profile is open, \
         the extrusion may not have inner profiles. If the extrusion already \
         has a profile, the set will fail.
