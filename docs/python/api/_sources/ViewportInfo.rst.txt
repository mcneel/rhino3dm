.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: ViewportInfo

   .. py:method:: ViewportInfo()

      ViewportInfo constructor


   .. py:attribute:: IsValidCameraFrame


   .. py:attribute:: IsValidCamera

      bool: Gets a value that indicates whether the camera is valid.

   .. py:attribute:: IsValidFrustum

      bool: Gets a value that indicates whether the frustum is valid.

   .. py:attribute:: IsParallelProjection

      bool: Get or set whether this projection is parallel.

   .. py:attribute:: IsPerspectiveProjection

      bool: Get or set whether this projection is perspective.

   .. py:attribute:: IsTwoPointPerspectiveProjection

      bool: Gets a value that indicates whether this projection is a two-point perspective.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraLocation

      rhino3dm.Point3d: Gets the camera location (position) point.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraDirection

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the direction that the camera faces.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraUp

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the camera up vector.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraX

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the unit "to the right" vector.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraY

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the unit "up" vector.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraZ

      rhino3dm.Vector3d: Gets the unit vector in -CameraDirection.

   .. py:attribute:: ScreenPortAspect

      float: Gets the screen aspect ratio.
      This is width / height.

   .. py:attribute:: CameraAngle

      float: Gets or sets the 1/2 smallest angle. See  for more information.

   .. py:attribute:: Camera35mmLensLength

      float: This property assumes the camera is horizontal and crop the
      film rather than the image when the aspect of the frustum
      is not 36/24.  (35mm film is 36mm wide and 24mm high.)
      Setting preserves camera location,
      changes the frustum, but maintains the frustum's aspect.

   .. py:attribute:: TargetPoint

      rhino3dm.Point3d: The current value of the target point.  This point does not play
      a role in the view projection calculations.  It can be used as a
      fixed point when changing the camera so the visible regions of the
      before and after frustums both contain the region of interest.
      The default constructor sets this point on ON_3dPoint::UnsetPoint.
      You must explicitly call one SetTargetPoint() functions to set
      the target point.

   .. py:attribute:: Id

      Guid: Sets the viewport's id to the value used to
      uniquely identify this viewport.
      There is no approved way to change the viewport
      id once it is set in order to maintain consistency
      across multiple viewports and those routines that
      manage them.

   .. py:staticmethod:: DefaultTop()

      [todo] add documentation

   .. py:staticmethod:: DefaultPerspective()

      [todo] add documentation

   .. py:method:: ChangeToParallelProjection(symmetricFrustum)

      Use this function to change projections of valid viewports
      from parallel to perspective.  It will make common additional
      adjustments to the frustum and camera location so the resulting
      views are similar.  The camera direction and target point are
      not be changed.
      If the current projection is parallel and symmetricFrustum,
      FrustumIsLeftRightSymmetric() and FrustumIsTopBottomSymmetric()
      are all equal, then no changes are made and True is returned.

      :param bool symmetricFrustum: True if you want the resulting frustum to be symmetric.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded; otherwise, false.

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: ChangeToPerspectiveProjection(targetDistance, symmetricFrustum, lensLength)

      Use this function to change projections of valid viewports
      from parallel to perspective.  It will make common additional
      adjustments to the frustum and camera location so the resulting
      views are similar.  The camera direction and target point are
      not changed.
      If the current projection is perspective and symmetricFrustum,
      IsFrustumIsLeftRightSymmetric, and IsFrustumIsTopBottomSymmetric
      are all equal, then no changes are made and True is returned.

      :param float targetDistance: If RhinoMath.UnsetValue this parameter is ignored. \
         Otherwise it must be > 0 and indicates which plane in the current view frustum should be preserved.
      :param bool symmetricFrustum: True if you want the resulting frustum to be symmetric.
      :param float lensLength: (pass 50.0 when in doubt) \
         35 mm lens length to use when changing from parallel \
         to perspective projections. If the current projection \
         is perspective or lens_length is <= 0.0, \
         then this parameter is ignored.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded; otherwise, false.

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: ChangeToTwoPointPerspectiveProjection(targetDistance, up, lensLength)

      Changes projections of valid viewports
      to a two point perspective.  It will make common additional
      adjustments to the frustum and camera location and direction
      so the resulting views are similar.
      If the current projection is perspective and
      IsFrustumIsLeftRightSymmetric is True and
      IsFrustumIsTopBottomSymmetric is false, then no changes are
      made and True is returned.

      :param float targetDistance: If RhinoMath.UnsetValue this parameter is ignored.  Otherwise \
         it must be > 0 and indicates which plane in the current \
         view frustum should be preserved.
      :param rhino3dm.Vector3d up: The locked up direction. Pass Vector3d.Zero if you want to use the world \
         axis direction that is closest to the current up direction. \
         Pass CameraY() if you want to preserve the current up direction.
      :param float lensLength: (pass 50.0 when in doubt) \
         35 mm lens length to use when changing from parallel \
         to perspective projections. If the current projection \
         is perspective or lens_length is <= 0.0, \
         then this parameter is ignored.

      :return: True if the operation succeeded; otherwise, false.

      // For a Windows window
      /      int width = width of window client area in pixels;

   .. py:method:: Extents(halfViewAngleRadians, worldBbox)

      Extends this viewport view to include a bounding box.
      Use Extents() as a quick way to set a viewport to so that bounding
      volume is inside of a viewports frustum.
      The view angle is used to determine the position of the camera.

      :param float halfViewAngleRadians: 1/2 smallest subtended view angle in radians.

   .. py:method:: DollyExtents(bbox, border)

      Dolly the camera location and so that the view frustum contains
      all of the document objects that can be seen in view.
      If the projection is perspective, the camera angle is not changed.

      :return: True if successful.

      :rtype: bool

   .. py:method:: FrustumCenterPoint(targetDistance)

      Return a point on the central axis of the view frustum.
      This point is a good choice for a general purpose target point.

      :param float targetDistance: If targetDistance > 0.0, then the distance from the returned \
         point to the camera plane will be targetDistance. Note that \
         if the frustum is not symmetric, the distance from the \
         returned point to the camera location will be larger than \
         targetDistance. \
         If targetDistance == ON_UNSET_VALUE and the frustum \
         is valid with near > 0.0, then 0.5*(near + far) will be used \
         as the targetDistance.

      :return: A point on the frustum's central axis.  If the viewport or input \
         is not valid, then ON_3dPoint::UnsetPoint is returned.

      :rtype: rhino3dm.Point3d

   .. py:method:: TargetDistance(useFrustumCenterFallback)

      Gets the distance from the target point to the camera plane.
      Note that if the frustum is not symmetric, then this distance
      is shorter than the distance from the target to the camera location.

      :param bool useFrustumCenterFallback: If bUseFrustumCenterFallback is False and the target point is \
         not valid, then ON_UNSET_VALUE is returned. \
         If bUseFrustumCenterFallback is True and the frustum is valid \
         and current target point is not valid or is behind the camera, \
         then 0.5*(near + far) is returned.

      :return: Shortest signed distance from camera plane to target point. \
         If the target point is on the visible side of the camera, \
         a positive value is returned.  ON_UNSET_VALUE is returned \
         when the input of view is not valid.

      :rtype: float
