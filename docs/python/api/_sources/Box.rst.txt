.. py:module:: rhino3dm

.. py:class:: Box

   .. py:method:: Box()

      Box constructor


   .. py:attribute:: IsValid

      bool: Gets the validity of this Box. Boxes are invalid when the base plane or any of
      the dimension intervals are invalid or decreasing.

   .. py:attribute:: Center

      rhino3dm.Point3d: Gets the point that is in the center of the box.

   .. py:attribute:: Area

      float: Gets the total surface area of this box.

   .. py:attribute:: Volume

      float: Gets the total volume of this box.

   .. py:method:: PointAt(x, y, z)

      Evaluates the box volume at the given unitized parameters.
      The box has idealized side length of 1x1x1.

      :param float x: Unitized parameter (between 0 and 1 is inside the box) along box X direction.
      :param float y: Unitized parameter (between 0 and 1 is inside the box) along box Y direction.
      :param float z: Unitized parameter (between 0 and 1 is inside the box) along box Z direction.

      :return: The point at (x,y,z).
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Point3d

   .. py:method:: ClosestPoint(point)

      Finds the closest point on or in the Box. The box should be Valid for this to work.

      :param rhino3dm.Point3d point: Sample point.

      :return: The point on or in the box that is closest to the sample point.
      :rtype: rhino3dm.Point3d

   .. py:method:: Transform(xform)

      Transforms this Box using a Transformation matrix. If the Transform does not preserve
      Similarity, the dimensions of the resulting box cannot be trusted.

      :param Transform xform: Transformation matrix to apply to this Box.

      :return: True if the Box was successfully transformed, False if otherwise.
      :rtype: bool
