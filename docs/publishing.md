# Publishing new versions

## JavaScript

### Node.js

1. Build rhino3dm.js, rhino3dm.wasm, and rhino3dm.module.js (or get them from the [Github Repo Actions Artifacts](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/actions) )
2. Build and run docgen (for type definitions). See `src/docgen/make_javascript_docs.bat`. This will be in the `src/docgen/out/js_tsdef` directory
3. Create a new directory and copy in rhino3dm.js, rhino3dm.wasm, rhino3dm.module.js and rhino3dm.d.ts
4. Copy in RHINO3DM.JS.md from `docs/javascript` and rename to README.md
6. Update the version number in package.json and copy that in too
7. From inside the new directory, run `npm publish` (see note 2). You might need to run `npm login` prior to publishing.

See https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages for more info.

#### Notes:
1. After creating a user on npm.org, ask Will to add you to the mcneel team!
2. If publishing a pre-release, e.g. `0.4.0-dev`, use `npm publish --tag next` ([source](https://medium.com/@mbostock/prereleases-and-npm-e778fc5e2420))

## dotnet

1. Run a `workflow_release` workflow from the rhino3dm repository Actions: https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm/actions/workflows/workflow_release.yml. This will build all of the rhino3dm versions, including a nupkg for rhino3m dotnet. 
2. Download the `rhino3dm.net nupkg` artifact generated from running the `workflow_release` workflow. This will result in a `rhino3dm.net nupkg.zip` downloaded to your computer.
3. Unzip the `rhino3dm.net nupkg.zip` file. This will result in a new folder named `rhino3dm.net nupkg` that will contain a `Rhino3dm.*.*.*.nupkg` numbered according to the current version.
4. Open a terminal and direct it to the `rhino3dm.net nupkg` folder created from unzipping the file in step 3.
5. Push the package to NuGet with `dotnet nuget push...`, replacing the wildcards with the version number, and entering your API Key from NuGet.org (see note 1). 

```bash
dotnet nuget push Rhino3dm.*.*.*.nupkg -k <APIKEY> -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
```

6. If all went wekk you should see something similar in the terminal: 

```
Pushing Rhino3dm.7.7.0.nupkg to 'https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package'...
  PUT https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/
  Created https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/ 3801ms
Your package was pushed.
```

7. The newly created package will take a few minutes to validate on NuGet.org. You can check the status at the Rhino3dm page: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rhino3dm/
