# rhino3dm.js

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/rhino3dm/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/rhino3dm)

**rhino3dm.js** is a javascript library with associated web assembly (rhino3dm.wasm) that is OpenNURBS plus additional C++ to javascript bindings compiled to web assembly. The library based on OpenNURBS with a RhinoCommon style. The libraries will run on on all major browsers as well as node.js.

For browser based applications, we also develop a 3dmLoader for the popular three.js WebGL library: https://threejs.org/examples/?q=3dm#webgl_loader_3dm


## Usage

The easiest way to get started is to reference a specific version of the library using jsDelivr.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>

  <!-- Import maps polyfill -->
  <!-- Remove this when import maps will be widely supported -->
  <script async src="https://unpkg.com/es-module-shims@1.10.0/dist/es-module-shims.js"></script>

  <script type="importmap">
      {
          "imports": {
            "rhino3dm":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rhino3dm@8.17.0/rhino3dm.module.min.js"
          }
      }
  </script>

  <script type="module">

    import rhino3dm from 'rhino3dm'
    const rhino = await rhino3dm()
    const sphere = new rhino.Sphere( [1,2,3,], 12 )
    console.log(sphere.diameter)

  </script>

</body>

</html>
```

You can also [download the files](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/rhino3dm) if you want to bake them into your site or application. You'll need the `.wasm` web assembly along with the `.js` (or `.min.js`) wrapper.


### Node.js

**rhino3dm.js** is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rhino3dm); try `npm install rhino3dm`. Note: the resulting webassembly binary (rhino3dm.wasm) is fairly large for browser based applications. We are working on ways to make this smaller.

Example node.js script:

```js
import rhino3dm from 'rhino3dm'
const rhino = await rhino3dm()
const sphere = new rhino.Sphere([1,2,3,], 12)
console.log(sphere.diameter)
```

### React.js

Similar to plain html, **rhino3dm.js** can be added as a script in `index.js`

```js
// index.js
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rhino3dm@8.17.0/rhino3dm.min.js";
script.addEventListener("load", () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <StrictMode>
      <App />
    </StrictMode>,
    rootElement
  );
});
document.body.appendChild(script);

```

Once loaded, `rhino3dm` can be referenced in any component with `window.rhino3dm`, keep in mind that the wasm file loads asycnhronously so any any calls to wasm methods need to happen inside `.then()` or using `await`

```js
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  const [sphere, setSphere] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    window.rhino3dm().then((Module) => {
      //creating a sphere using rhino3dm
      setSphere(new Module.Sphere([1, 2, 3], 16));
    });
  }, []);

  return <div className="App">{sphere && <p>{`sphere diameter is: ${sphere.diameter}`}</p>}</div>;
}
```

## API Docs

The latest [rhino3dm.js API Documentation](https://mcneel.github.io/rhino3dm/javascript/api/index.html)


## Examples

There a few samples are available in the [Rhino Developer Samples repository](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples/tree/8/rhino3dm#samples)

An advanced sample creates a 3dm file viewer in a web browser.  The html+javascript to create the viewer is around 300 lines (including comments) and runs on all browsers including mobile devices.

**rhino3dm.js** is used to read a 3dm file and create an instance of a File3dm class in the browserâ€™s memory.  It then walks through the objects in the model and calls compute.rhino3d.com to create meshes and isocurves for the polysurface. These meshes and isocurves are then added to a three.js scene for display.

Here's [another example](https://observablehq.com/@pearswj/using-rhino3dm-in-observable/2) of rhino3dm.js, this time running in one of [Observable](http://observablehq.com/)'s live notebooks. Dive right in an tweak the code!

## Build from source

If the pre-compiled libraries above do not work in your situation, you can compile the libraries from their source. For detailed instructions go to [rhino3dm.js and rhino3dm.wasm](RHINO3DM-BUILD.JS.md)
